= Project: Watering System

This project makes use of an Arduino nano 33 IoT and the arduino Cloud infrastructure to create an automatic 
watering system for garden plants. Make sure to download the required libraries for the Arduino nano 33 IoT board, 
wifi and arduino cloud functionalities. You will also need the DHT and I2C libraries for the sensor.
